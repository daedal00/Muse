# Muse - Music Discovery & Review Platform

A music discovery and review platform inspired by Letterboxd, but for music. Rate albums, create playlists, discover new music, and share your musical journey with others.

## 🎵 What is Muse?

Muse allows users to:

- **Rate and review albums** (1-5 stars) with detailed reviews
- **Create and share playlists** with other users
- **Discover new music** through personalized recommendations
- **Track your musical journey** with a personal "My Muse" profile
- **Search and explore** artists, albums, and tracks via Spotify integration
- **Convert playlists** between different streaming services (planned)

## 🏗️ Current Architecture

### Backend (Implemented)

- **GraphQL API** built with Go and `gqlgen`
- **PostgreSQL** database for all persistent data
- **Redis** for session management and caching (optional)
- **Spotify API integration** for music data and search
- **JWT Authentication** for secure user sessions
- **Docker support** for easy deployment

### Frontend (Planned)

- **React (TypeScript)** for web application
- **React Native** for mobile apps
